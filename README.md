# Onboarding animation prototype

This project is a re-design of a client project and my first attempt at crafting modern and dynamic U.I with the use of animations such as Fade, Scale, Slide, and custom page transitions as well as resolving a common problem with the login page(s) on mobile which causes keyboard input to hide the submit button.
